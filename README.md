Mobile App Data Analysis with SQL Server
This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for performing statistical analysis on different versions of a mobile app using experimental analysis or A/B testing. The goal is to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the two versions of the app.

This repository contains mobile app data with different attributes for different versions of the app. The data can be used to perform experimenting analysis or AB testing, both binary (using chi-squared test) and continuous (using t-test), to see if there is any statistical significance for any of the two versions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains mobile app records, including information such as app version, game rounds, and retention. The dataset is assumed to be stored in a SQL Server database and accessed through SQL queries.

# Prerequisites
To use the SQL scripts in this repository, you need the following:
1. SQL Server Management Studio or any other SQL Server client tool.
2. Access to a SQL Server database with the mobile app data.
